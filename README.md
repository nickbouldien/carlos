# Carlos

A cross between Carlo and create-react-app

### Run in dev:
- clone and then install dependencies (run `yarn install`)
- run `yarn build` (creates production build to serve)
- run `yarn server`


(currently just ~~stealing~~ borrowing functionality from the carlo repo)


### Sources:
- [carlo repo](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/carlo)

### Contributing:
This is just for fun, but if you find any problems or want to add more functionality, feel free to open up an issue and/or pull request.
